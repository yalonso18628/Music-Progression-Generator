# Music-Progression-Generator
Simple chord progression randomizer. 

On my free time I like to write music. I made it my goal to make my own little EP within the next few months. But I realized that I overcomplicate my music. 

So my goal with this program was to generator a random two chord progression from a random key. 

When called, the program will generate a random key, two chords, and the scale for that key. 

As of now I made so that the program can only generator major or minor scales. 

Future Goals:
- A future goal would be to generate different kinds of scales for different keys.
- I also hope to make it more user friendly by allowing the user to surf through the
  other scales within the same key and even other common chord progressions.
